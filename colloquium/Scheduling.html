<h2>Colloquia Scheduling</h2>


UNL faculty and graduate students are encouraged to suggest
colloquium speakers.  When you consider inviting someone as a possible
colloquium speaker, please consider whether that person is likely to give a
good talk to a general mathematical audience.  It is not good when a
speaker gives a specialized seminar that only a very few in the
colloquium audience can follow. Here are some guidelines which
speakers should follow (you should let the speakers you host know
these): <ul> <li> Colloquia are to be 50 minutes long.  <li> The
audience for a colloquium expects a lecture geared to
non-specialists. Give motivation for the work to be discussed and target the lecture for a very general mathematical
audience&mdash;a first or second year graduate student should understand
most of the talk. It is usually a good idea to remind the audience of
  definitions.
  <li> Speakers are advised to consult with <A href="https://xperezgi.github.io/colloquium/UNLGoodColloqGuide.html">
  UNL's Friendly Advice for Colloquium Speakers </a>. Speakers  might also wish to consult John McCarthy's
excellent article, <a
 href="http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/workshops/gcoll.pdf">  ``How to give a good colloquium'' </a> 

</ul>

The remainder of this page is intended to help with colloquium
scheduling.
To schedule a colloquium, please do the following. 
<ol>
  <li> <b>Consult the
  <A href="https://xperezgi.github.io/colloquium/opendates.pdf">list
of open dates</a>. </b> 
 <li> 
<b> Send an email </b> to Xavier Pérez Giménez (xperez@unl.edu) with 
 the following information:  
  <ul>
    <li> <b> Information on Visitor:</b> The following information is
    needed 
 <i> as soon as possible </i> for scheduling and
 advertising the
 talk.
<ul>
<li> Visitor name, 
<li> Colloquium Date Requested
<li> Organizational affiliation, 
<li> Professional Title
<li> Colloquium Title and Abstract.  Titles and abstracts should
 be in plain text (ASCII), preferably <em>without </em> TeX or
  LATeX. <br> <em>Note:</em>  Because colloquia are often scheduled
  well in advance, the title and abstract do not need to be
  provided when you schedule the colloquium, but
  please provide them at least 2 weeks before the talk.
<li> Acknowledgments needed in advertising (e.g. Research Council or
 NSF support, etc.)
</ul>
<li> <b>Any special needs for the talk</b> 

<!--
<i> Research Council Deadlines for Visiting Scholar Grants: </i>
<ul>
   <li> February 16, 2004 for Fall 2004 visitors.
  <li> October 15, 2003  for Spring 2004 visitors, 
 -->


</ul> 

<li> <b> Funding: </b>  The department has funds available to help
 defray costs of speakers.  To obtain these funds, contact Petronela Radu. Use of other funding sources
(e.g. grants, Research
Council, etc) before requesting departmental support
is strongly encouraged.

</ul>

<h3>Rules of Thumb regarding reserving a colloquium slot:</h3>

The rules of thumb below are meant to help scheduling of 
colloquia go smoothly. Let me know if you see changes
or additions that would promote this goal.

<ul>

<li> First come first served; let me know as soon as possible if you
would like to reserve a slot.
<!--<li> The table below lists colloquia dates both open and presently -->
<!--reserved.
  -->
<li> There is a general feeling that local speakers should
defer to visitors; if you reserve a spot for yourself
to talk on a date that someone else, whom we shall call X, would 
like to have a visitor speak, it is appropriate for X to 
talk to you about giving up your slot. Whether you do or not
is between you and X.

<!-- <li> It is OK to request a slot before you have 
a specific speaker, but until I receive assurance that you
have a specific speaker who will use that slot, I regard such 
a reservation as tentative, and I will direct inquiries about using 
the slot your way.

<li> In order to advertise your visitor's talk,
I will need some information no later than early in the 
month preceding your visitor's talk. The information I need is listed below.
(Let me know if you have special needs, e.g. a larger room.):
<ul>
<li>Date:

<li>Time: 4:00-4:50
<li>Room: Oldfather Hall 208
<li>Event: Colloquium, Department of Mathematics and Statistics

<li>Speaker(s):
<li>Professional Title: Professor
<li>Organizational Affiliation(s):
<li>Title of talk:
<li>Abstract:
<li>Funding Source to acknowledge (are research council funds are being used?):
</ul>

<li> I would be happy to create a link to your visitor's home page
or link the talk title to another site with additional resources.
Let me know if your visitor would like such a link.
-->
</ul>

<h2> Current Tentative Spring 2004-Fall 2004 Schedule</h2></a>
<br>

<p> Notes on Dates: 
<ul> 
<li>  Beginning with the Fall 2004 Semester, the standard colloquium
date will move to Fridays.

<li> The 2004 Regional Workshop is November 5 and March 18 falls
during spring break; thus those dates are not listed in the table.
<li> Several longer-term visitors or local speakers have agreed to
speak.  Their names are marked with an asterisk (*) to indicate that
their dates may be moved if necessary to accomodate out-ot-town
speakers.  </ul>
