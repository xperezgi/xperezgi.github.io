<h2 align=center>Some Friendly Advice for UN-L Colloquium Speakers</h2>
  
           In our Department, all faculty and graduate students attend the
       colloquium.  Because our interests are highly diverse, speakers
are expected to give talks which are accessible (at least in good part)
       to a varied audience.  Giving such talks is a difficult art, and there
       is no pat formula, but experienced colloquium speakers
often keep the following advice in mind.  We provide it below, with
       the hope that speakers might find it useful.

 which we list here with the

       <li>Speakers remember at all times that they are not speaking to an
           audience of specialists, or even to a broad category of people
           such as "pure mathematicians", "applied mathematicians", or
           "statisticians".  When they prefer to talk to a narrower 
           audience, they ask their host to schedule 
           seminar talks instead.
   
       <li>Speakers eschew jargon or take a moment to explain it, but at the same time
avoid streams of elementary definitions which likely would be 
           dull.
   
       <li>Speakers use many vehicles for transmitting information 
           (blackboard, overhead projector, or other), but 
are careful to do so at a 
           reasonable rate.  Almost certainly, few  absorb 
           material placed on transparencies, unless it is printed in a very 
           large (at least fourteen point) font and is left in place long enough to be read.
   
       <li>Speakers appreciate that a picture is worth a thousand words.  Our
colloquia last only fifty minutes, and so it can be better to inform the
audience's intuition
           graphically, rather than to give a precise explanation of every 
           concept.
   
       <li>Speakers know  audiences love context.  If Gauss thought about the problem, 
they would tell us.
           It is also interesting to hear about connections with other areas of mathematics 
           or other sciences, although exhaustive lists of names and dates are
           usually of interest only to specialists.
   
       <li>Speakers show informative examples, knowing how effective this can be
           in reaching out to people who might otherwise not know what is
           being discussed.
   
       <li>Speakers grab the audience's interest with a special case, leaving us after the lecture, to
           go to the library to learn more.
